disply the tree nodes by level, by using both the
breadth-first-search and
depth-first-search (preorder)

note: for depth-first-search, i could have used postorder as well.

root node is at level: 0
all the nodes at one edge away from the root are at level: 1
and so on.

output: dict of sets
note:   key is level, value is set of nodes at that level
